    Algorithm::Permute - Handy and fast permutation with object oriented
    interface

As of version 0.11, a different implementation of the same permutation
generator algorithm can be chosen at compile time. This one uses linked list
instead of array, and hopefully a little bit faster. 

To enable this, run Makefile.PL with a custom DEFINE argument:
perl Makefile.PL DEFINE="-DPERL_EXT -DUSE_LINKEDLIST"

This option only affects the iterative style (OO) interface. The callback 
interface remains unaffected.
